I just helped my friend land a job using X in 48 hours.

While everyone else applies to the same stale job boards, I gave him this one prompt for Grok.

Steal this prompt:

'''
Search X for recent tweets containing job opportunities in [YOUR FIELD]. Find posts from the last 48 hours that include terms like 'hiring', 'looking for', 'job opening', 'we're hiring', 'join our team', or 'remote position' combined with [SPECIFIC SKILLS/ROLE].

Focus on:
- Startup founders posting directly
- Companies announcing new roles
- Recruiters sharing fresh openings
- People retweeting job posts

Extract: Company name, role, requirements, contact info, and tweet link. Prioritize posts with under 50 replies (less competition)."

'''

How to use it:

1. Replace [YOUR FIELD] with your specialty (e.g., "software engineering", "product design", "marketing")
2. Replace [SPECIFIC SKILLS/ROLE] with exact terms (e.g., "React developer", "growth marketer", "UX designer")
3. Paste into Grok
4. Run every 12 hours for fresh results

Why this destroys traditional job hunting:

- You catch opportunities before they hit job boards
- Direct access to hiring managers and founders
- Zero competition from mass applicants
- Real-time market intelligence

I've watched people land interviews within hours of posts going live. The X job market moves faster than LinkedIn, Indeed, or any traditional platform.
