I just helped my friend land a job using X in 48 hours.

While everyone else applies to the same stale job boards, I gave him this one prompt for Grok.

Steal this prompt:

'''
Search X for recent tweets containing job opportunities in [YOUR FIELD]. Find posts from the last 48 hours that include terms like 'hiring', 'looking for', 'job opening', 'we're hiring', 'join our team', or 'remote position' combined with [SPECIFIC SKILLS/ROLE].

Focus on:
- Startup founders posting directly
- Companies announcing new roles
- Recruiters sharing fresh openings
- People retweeting job posts

Extract: Company name, role, requirements, contact info, and tweet link. Prioritize posts with under 50 replies (less competition)."

'''

How to use it:

1. Replace [YOUR FIELD] with your specialty (e.g., "software engineering", "product design", "marketing")
2. Replace [SPECIFIC SKILLS/ROLE] with exact terms (e.g., "React developer", "growth marketer", "UX designer")
3. Paste into Grok
4. Run every 12 hours for fresh results

Why this destroys traditional job hunting:

- You catch opportunities before they hit job boards
- Direct access to hiring managers and founders
- Zero competition from mass applicants
- Real-time market intelligence

I've watched people land interviews within hours of posts going live. The X job market moves faster than LinkedIn, Indeed, or any traditional platform.

The secret isn't the prompt. It's understanding that the best opportunities never make it to job boards. They get filled through networks, and X is the world's largest professional network in disguise.

Stop applying to 6-month-old postings. Start hunting where jobs are born.
